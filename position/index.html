  <h1><a href="..">Cookbook</a> >> CSS Positioning</h1>
  <p>
    Here is a list of recipes that demonstrate various types of positioning.

  <dl>
    <dt><a href="./fixed-menu.html">Basic fixed menu</a></dt>
    <dd>
      A basic fixed menu using CSS positioning
    </dd>

    <dt><a href="./sticky-menu-footer.html">Sticky menu and footer</a></dt>
    <dd>
      Demonstrates a page with a hero image with sticky menus and a sticky footer.
    </dd>

    <dt><a href="./sticky-headings.html">Sticky headings</a></dt>
    <dd>
      Demonstrates applying the <code>position: sticky</code> property to multiple
      headings in a document. The headings stick to the top of the page and
      overlap one and other as you scroll down.
    </dd>

    <dt><a href="./z-index.html">Z-Index</a></dt>
    <dd>
      A demonstration of using CSS's <code>z-index</code> property to override the
      default ordering that the browser would use. Normally, you should not need to
      set this property. Instead, you should order your HTML elements so that the
      browser performs this task for you. However, when writing components in frameworks
      like React, Angular, or Vue, you don't always have control over how your HTML
      gets ordered.
